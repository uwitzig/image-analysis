# Watson Hands On Labs - ðŸ“· Image Analysis.

The labs cover several [Watson Services][wdc_services] that are available on [IBM Bluemix][bluemix] to build a simple image analysis application. Throughout the workshop, we will navigate through Bluemix, Bluemix Devops Services, Github, and the source code of our application in order to demonstrate how apps can be created quickly and easily using the [IBM Bluemix][bluemix] platform, and the value of [Watson Services][wdc_services] and Cognitive capabilities through APIs.

So letâ€™s get started. The first thing to do is to build out the shell of our application in Bluemix.

## Creating a [IBM Bluemix][bluemix] Account

  1. Go to [https://bluemix.net/](https://bluemix.net/)
  2. Create a Bluemix account if required.
  3. Log in with your IBM ID (the ID used to create your Bluemix account)

**Note:** The confirmation email from Bluemix mail may take up to 1 hour.


## Create visual_recognition and text_to_speech service in [IBM Bluemix][bluemix]

1. Install the cloudfoundry CLI needed to connect to Bluemix from command line:

   https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases

2. Run the following commands to connect to your Bluemix account:

    `cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net/` for US or 
    `cf api https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net/` for United Kingdom

    `cf login -u <<your Bluemix account>>`

    When prompted, enter your Bluemix password

3. Visual Recognition service

    Get information about the service: 
    `cf marketplace -s watson_vision_combined`

    Create the free service with name csad_vr: 
    `cf create-service watson_vision_combined free my-visual-recognition`

    Generate authentication credentials: 
    `cf create-service-key my-visual-recognition credentials-1`

    Retrieve the new credentials: 
    `cf service-key my-visual-recognition credentials-1`

4. Text-to-Speech service

    Create the standard service with name csad_tts `cf create-service text_to_speech standard my-text-to-speech`

    Generate authentication credentials `cf create-service-key my-text-to-speech credentials-1`

    Retrieve the new credentials `cf service-key my-text-to-speech credentials-1`


## Configure and run this application locally

The application uses [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) so you will have to download and install them as part of the step 1 below.

1. Install [Node.js] from http://nodejs.org/

2. Clone the app structure and files that is hosted on github

   https://github.com/uwitzig/image-analysis/


3. Edit config.js to add the credentials previously retrieved. (visual_recognition and text_to_speech)

   Leave the credentials for the language-translator empty for now.

4. Go to the project folder in a terminal and run the following command to install all dependencies

    `npm install`

5. Start the application

    `npm start`

6. Test the application at: http://localhost:3000

   You can select an image to classify it

   At this point you can classify images and use the text_to_speech service.

## Add language translation services to the application

In this section we'll see how to add the possibility of translating the text recognized to an other language before it's spoken by the Text-to-Speech service

1. Create a language translation service

    Create the standard service with name csad_lt `cf create-service language_translator standard my-language-translator`

    Generate authentication credentials: `cf create-service-key my-language-translator credentials-1`

    Retrieve the new credentials: `cf service-key my-language-translator credentials-1`

3. Edit the config.js file to add the new language translation service credentials, save the file

4. In app.js, uncomment line 33

5. Save

6. Restart the app
